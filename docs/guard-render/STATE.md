# Guard render: state

## Now
S1 (merged rigidly skinned guard body) implemented and pushed on `feature/guard-render` (commits a-f below), on master
4.68.0. Unit + NullEngine tests pass; nothing measured or seen on a GPU yet. Guards (`enemyRig.ts`) and carried /
fresh bodies (`body.ts`) opt in; `?guardmerge=0` gives the old instanced parts for comparisons.

## S1 done (2026-10-23)
- (a) 63c5bdfe `src/player/smoothBodyMerge.ts` (pure) + `tests/smoothBodyMerge.test.ts`: joint-space positions,
  normals = normalize(M3 * n), colour / pattern / color2, matricesIndices / weights, `ppos` / `pnrm`, per-part ranges,
  `flashColors` / `heatPattern` / `paintPart`, `restBox`.
- (b) 2901fde1 `src/player/smoothBody.ts`: one bone per joint node (bind identity), `onBeforeComputeObservable` pose
  (no allocation), one scene observer per scene for all bodies (`markAsDirty` + sticky ragdoll check -> always
  active), fixed root-local `BoundingInfo` on both meshes (rest box + PAD 1 m sideways, 0.3 m up / down), LOD via
  `getLOD` (the low mesh is blocked as an LOD level), merged geometry cached per (joints, parts, instance values),
  parts `setEnabled(false)`. `BoundingInfo` exported from `src/core/babylon.ts`.
- (c) 00012998 `src/player/smoothBodyPlugin.ts` (priority 220, `SMOOTHBODY` when `ppos` present: vPatPos / vSurfPos
  = ppos, vSurfNrm = pnrm) on `partSkinMat` before freeze; `src/world/partLibrary.ts`: base metadata `library`,
  `low(base)`, `trackLod(hi, lo)` (setLodScale moves merged LODs). No `world.ts` hunk needed (setLodScale already
  goes through the library).
- (d) 09f329f7 characterRig hook (CT Core's file, its own commit): `src/player/characterRig.ts` line 3 (import),
  1232 (`merge?: boolean` in the opts type), 1308-1309 (comment + `else if (opts.merge ...) this.voxel =
  buildSmoothBody(...)`), 1315 (`voxel: VoxelBody | SmoothBody | null`). Constructor + field only, no per-frame code,
  nothing in 1850-2010 / 2600-2700 or `src/anim`. Diff: `git show 09f329f7 -- src/player/characterRig.ts`.
- (e) 3c559e43 `merge: true` in `src/ai/enemyRig.ts` and `src/ai/body.ts`; `guardMerge` in `src/core/flags.ts`
  (`?guardmerge=0` off; `buildSmoothBody` returns null).
- (f) ac088549 `tests/smoothBody.test.ts` (NullEngine): a grunt rig with merge, walked 20 frames, moved and turned:
  every 7th vertex of every part, both LODs, skinned = instance world position (< 1e-4 m); colours; flash; ragdoll
  re-parent -> always active; one shared observer; `guardMerge = false` -> parts. Also fixed in (f): the per-mesh
  buffers were built lo-first while `meshes` is [hi, lo] (flash would have written the wrong buffer).
- Checks run: `tsc --noEmit -p .`, eslint on every changed file, vitest single files: smoothBodyMerge, smoothBody,
  voxel, animGear, coopTorches, enemyManagerDespawn, hearing, sectorRestart (all pass). No full check, no e2e.

## S1 doubts (for the checker / the GPU run)
- Not rendered on a GPU yet: the plugin's shader (PBR + SURF_OBJECT + BONES + VERTEXCOLOR) compiles only in the e2e /
  GPU run; a compile error would show as missing guards in smoke.
- LOD swap: the merged body switches as one at the body's sphere centre; the instances switched part by part (parts
  ~1 m from the centre swap slightly earlier / later near 16 m x Detail).
- `setHeadVisible` is a no-op (one mesh, no head split): only the player's camera fades a head, and the player keeps
  its own figure. Pattern scale is fixed at build (a joint scaled at run time would not stretch the pattern).
- Rest box margins (1 m / 0.3 m) are a guess: a keyed pose reaching further than 1 m past the rest box (takedown
  victim, lying without a ragdoll: the root itself rotates, so `lay` is fine) could cull a frame early at the screen
  edge. Ragdolls re-parent the joints, so they go always-active.

## Next
1. Fresh checker for S1 (session-method), then Character Build on the laptop (port 4189, GPU alone):
   `E2E_GPU=1 E2E_PORT=4189 node scripts/guard-cap.mjs --maps=sectorops,ctcourse --counts=0,12,16,24 --cells=patrol,away,alert --out=docs/guard-render/run-s1`
   and the same with the merge off (the script has no query option; `--maps` takes `<mapId>:<mode>` and appends it
   raw): `--maps='warehouseOps:sector&sectorGuards=0&guardmerge=0,ctcourse:course&guardmerge=0' --out=docs/guard-render/run-s1-off`.
   Compare render() CPU, evaluation, active meshes, GPU, frame CPU (PLAN section 5); look check screenshots (normal,
   thermal, night vision) of one guard on and off.
2. e2e on the pushed head: smoke, stealth-ai, sectorops, ctcourse, coop, netmove, anim, takedown.
3. Send CT Core the hook (item d above) for `characterRig.ts`.
4. Then re-plan after S1's numbers (PLAN section 4); S2 / S3 next.

## Open
1-5: answered (BRIEF.md M1-M6).
6. GPU share (+1.1 ms a guard) is not explained by triangles; S1's run will show whether it was the per-pass
   instance-buffer uploads.

## Done
- 2026-10-23: step-1 analysis, BRIEF / PLAN / STATE written.
- 2026-10-23: S1 implemented (commits a-f, see "S1 done"); master 4.68.0 merged in before it.

## Resume prompt
```
You are the job lead for the Night Shift Mobile-Coop job "guard-render" (Babylon.js 9 + Havok PWA, desktop).
Worktree C:/NightShift/Mobile-Coop-guard-render, branch feature/guard-render. First: git fetch -q origin && git merge -q origin/master.
Read CLAUDE.md ("Sessions", "Hard rules", "Definition of done"), then docs/guard-render/BRIEF.md (answers M1-M6), PLAN.md and STATE.md.
Branch guard before every write:
cd /c/NightShift/Mobile-Coop-guard-render && test "$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)" = feature/guard-render && test "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" = "C:/NightShift/Mobile-Coop-guard-render"
Assumed decision A1: the no-perf-tuning rule is lifted for guard render cost only (undo: revert the job).
S1 (the merged rigidly skinned guard body) is implemented and pushed (STATE.md "S1 done", "S1 doubts").
Do next, per STATE.md "Next": a fresh checker on S1 (docs/systems/session-method.md); ask Character Build for the S1
guard-cap run on the laptop GPU (port 4189, alone), merge on and ?guardmerge=0, and the e2e suites smoke stealth-ai
sectorops ctcourse coop netmove anim takedown on the pushed head; send CT Core the characterRig hook (STATE.md item d).
Then re-plan from the numbers (PLAN section 4). Keep gameplay off graphics state and light parity (PLAN section 2).
Update STATE.md, commit (end with "Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"), push, report to the orchestrator.
```
