# Track A (Night Shift | Course Ready Build) - resume

Written 2026-10-22 ~09:10, updated ~10:30 after the resume. Read CLAUDE.md, docs/ROADMAP.md, docs/marlow-bays/BRIEF.md (items
24, 29, 30 and "Tracks") and this file. Report to "Night Shift | Orchestrator".

## Open jobs

| Job | Branch / worktree | Head | State | Next |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Item 29 tuner v3 | `feature/tuner-v3` | merged | #97 merged as 4.49.0 (c38feca2). The JOBS=2 e2e-lightbake 16/17 was a timing race (solo 20/20, 26/26); v3 adds no materials | Done. Backlog: e2e-lightbake PBR-plugin assert should wait for the scene to settle |
| Item 24 guard tuning | `feature/guard-tune`, `C:/NightShift/Mobile-Coop-guard-tune` | 555a6a57 (master 4.49.0 merged) | PR Tekcry/Mobile-Coop#105 open; Character Build check + full e2e queued (~11:00-11:35) | On green: tell the orchestrator (he merges) |
| Item 30 key tools + exact preview | `feature/key-tools`, `C:/NightShift/Mobile-Coop-key-tools` | 0d25265c (master 4.49.0 merged) | PR Tekcry/Mobile-Coop#106 open. Checker FIX (Add key moved the trunk on multi-axis edits), fixed in the fix round 65da90cf; midpoint test tightened. vitest 2606. Menu Notes told. Character Build full e2e queued after #105 | On green: tell the orchestrator; when it merges, tell Menu Notes. Known, unmeasured: Add with the key file loaded and no edit live reads the per-field Euler trunk |

Next (orchestrator, 10:30): stay idle (usage tight) until Menu Notes N0 audit (docs/anim-natural/AUDIT.md) lands; then the N4 rows in track A files (tuner / studio UI for the new sliders, studio loops).
Merged tonight (track A): #81 coop-torches 4.34.0, #82 T 4.35.0, #83 T1a 4.36.0, #86 T2 4.39.0, #87 item 23 4.40.0,
#89 items 26 / 26b 4.41.0, #91 item 25 4.43.0.

## Item 24 PR body (summary)
Guard tuning: a Who list (Wren / Guard) in the v3 what-row (Body, Stepping, Weight tabs); a guard puppet in the studio
(real grunt rig, no AI); rows `guard.joint.<row>`, `guard.step.<gait>`, `guard.weight.<row>` (`src/anim/tuneGuard.ts`);
generated `src/anim/animBaseGuard.ts` baked by `src/anim/tuneBakeGuard.ts`; `src/ai/enemyRig.ts:18`
`rig.guardRows = true;` the one flag line; Wren's Stepping rows no longer reach guards; VIP / dummy / carried body read
an identity stepping table; guards untuned bit-identical. Edits marked "(item 24, track A)" in tuneJoints.ts,
characterRig.ts, tuneStep.ts, footPlanner.ts, player.ts. Checker's two findings fixed.

## Rules carried
- One checker per slice, one fix round; full e2e on the laptop first (Character Build, E2E_JOBS=2); the desktop runs a
  full e2e only at E2E_JOBS=1 when the laptop is busy; named suites wherever free. Version set at merge (G183).
- Desktop heavy lock: take it atomically, `( set -o noclobber; echo "<session> | <job> | <time>" > C:/NightShift/heavy.lock )`,
  retry if it exists, never overwrite, delete only if it still names you; each e2e its own `E2E_PORT`.
- Usage: check `get_usage` before each agent; pause at 97% at a clean commit and tell the orchestrator; the orchestrator
  sets how many agents run at once.
- Track A owns `src/ui/tuner*`, `src/ui/studio*`, `src/anim/studio.ts`, `src/anim/tuneKeys*`, `scripts/anim-keys/*`.
  Keep at merge: CT Core's `key_clip.py:481` ankle-frame fix (feature/anim-run-half), padGroup / backStep / fillLevels,
  `.debug-tune[hidden]` style, Reset baked (button under More), Menu Notes' `studio.ts` skeleton_test lines. New sliders
  from CT Core / Menu Notes (naturalness pass, docs/anim-natural/BRIEF.md) arrive through the registry and must bake.
- Michael's tuner rules: one layout for every input (only hint glyphs follow the input), layout from viewport size only,
  no search / recent / pins / body map, plain-English labels, subtle highlight with an off switch.
- Tell Menu Notes (track C) when key-file / tuneKeys PRs open and land.
