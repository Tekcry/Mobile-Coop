# Progression and saves
Purpose: progression maths, the save schema, migrations and the export format.
Design authority: docs/design-bible.md (Section 5.11)

## Progression and saves
- Pure maths in `progression/` (levels, rewards, upgrades, attachments, unlocks, profile ops). UI calls
  `app.save.update(d => op(d, ...))`; `SaveManager` sanitises, debounces and persists to IndexedDB.
- Save schema: `save/schema.ts` (`SAVE_VERSION`). Changing the shape = bump the version, add a
  migration in `save/migrations.ts` (input is the previous version's raw object), extend `sanitizeSave`,
  and add a test in `tests/save.test.ts` with a literal old save.
- Export format: `{ magic: 'shoulder-strike-save', version, exportedAt, data }`; import also accepts bare
  saves of any known version.
- New unlockables: add to `UNLOCKS` (or `registerUnlocks` from another module) with an id prefix
  (`weapon:`, `att:`, `camo:`, `part:`, `pattern:`, `emote:`, `tag:`, `color:`).
