# Notes collected for REVIEW.md (built at T9)

- Exceptions E5-E10 (SPEC) need Michael's confirmation; E1-E4 were approved in D10.
- Co-op light state is not synced to clients on the base branch (src/net/coopHost.ts has no light state; 2026-10-13
  grep). T1b adds a minimal light list to the `course` message as a stand-in for First Playable S7a / bible L10.
- `scripts/plan-svg.mjs` does not exist on the base branch; T2 creates it (template rule).
- T0: B6 supply duct entry moved onto a plant platform (feet 2.2) in A5's service passage; B3 duct one-way (spec change requests, LOG.md T0).
- T0: animation per character is over its scaled budget on the cloud VM at baseline (0.105 vs 0.067 ms): pre-existing, confirm on the PC.
- T1b: A6 revised: the dev solo flag lets one player cycle airlocks and both halves of pair gates (D21); drills still need real verbs (D30). The T1a checker had read RULES as ticks-only.
- T1b: e2e-course timed out once in a 2-job e2e:quick beside heavy suites (moveHost 5 s wait); passed serially twice; wait raised to 15 s.
