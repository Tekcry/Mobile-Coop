# Shoulder Strike - architecture and conventions

Mobile-only third-person over-the-shoulder shooter. Static web app (Vite + TypeScript + Babylon.js 9 + Havok),
installable PWA, fully playable offline. Hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Commands
- `npm run dev` - dev server (LAN-exposed for phone testing)
- `npm run build` - typecheck + production build into `dist/`
- `npm test` - Vitest unit tests (node env, `fake-indexeddb` for save tests)
- `npm run lint` - ESLint (typescript-eslint)
- `npm run icons` - regenerate procedural PWA icons into `public/icons/`
- `npm run e2e` - serves `dist/` and runs the headless e2e suites (needs a prior `npm run build`):
  - `scripts/smoke.mjs` boot + console-error check (`--shot=out.png` for a screenshot)
  - `scripts/e2e-pad.mjs` controller-only navigation through every menu using a fake Gamepad API pad
  - `scripts/e2e-touch.mjs` touch-only: taps menus, multi-touch drags the virtual sticks
  - `scripts/e2e-move.mjs` character controller checks on Proving Grounds
  - `scripts/e2e-combat.mjs` weapons, hits, headshots, reload, swap, grenades, barrels, death/respawn
  - `node scripts/shot.mjs out.png "autostart=proving" 60 "<js>"` screenshot helper (`?autostart=<mapId>`)
  Uses the preinstalled Chromium (Pixel 7 landscape emulation, SwiftShader GL - FPS there is not representative).

## Hard rules
- No runtime CDN or network dependency. All assets are bundled; Havok WASM is imported with `?url`.
- No external art/audio. Visuals are procedural/primitive; audio is WebAudio synthesis.
- Import Babylon only through `src/core/babylon.ts`. Babylon 9 is tree-shaken and stubs methods whose
  side-effect module is missing (it warns: "requires a side-effect import"). Add the side-effect import there.
- Important data goes to IndexedDB (`src/save`). `localStorage` is never used for saves.
- Coop code lives in `src/net` and is only reached through a dynamic `import()` behind `flags.coop`.
  Single player must never import from `src/net` statically.
- Strict TS (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `verbatimModuleSyntax`: use `import type`).

## Module layout (`src/`)
| Module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `core/` | `babylon.ts` import surface, engine creation, `GameLoop` (fixed 60Hz sim + manual Havok step), event bus, feature flags, scene manager |
| `input/` | Action map; touch, gamepad, keyboard/mouse sources all write the same `InputState` |
| `ui/` | DOM overlay UI. `FocusNav` spatial navigation shared by every menu; screen stack; HUD; debug overlay |
| `game/` | App states for play sessions (game state, modes, controls test) |
| `physics/` | Havok loading, collision groups, body budget |
| `player/` | Character controller (Havok `PhysicsCharacterController`), over-the-shoulder camera |
| `weapons/` | Data-driven weapons, hitscan + pooled projectiles, recoil/spread, grenades |
| `ai/` | Enemy state machines, grid navmesh + A*, cover points |
| `world/` | Modular tile kit and procedural map builders |
| `progression/` | XP/levels/currency maths, unlock tables, upgrade trees (pure, unit-tested) |
| `cosmetics/` | Avatar part catalogue, procedural materials/camos |
| `save/` | IndexedDB wrapper, versioned schema, migrations, export/import |
| `audio/` | WebAudio synth voices and mixer |
| `vfx/` | Pooled particles, tracers, decals |
| `net/` | Optional coop (Trystero), message schemas + validation |
| `pwa/` | Service worker registration, fullscreen/orientation, gesture suppression |
| `config/` | JSON/TS content data (weapons, enemies, unlock tables) |

## Game loop
`GameLoop` disables Babylon's automatic physics (`scene.physicsEnabled = false`) and steps Havok itself at a
fixed 1/60 s inside an accumulator (max 4 steps/frame, backlog dropped). Order per step:
`fixedUpdate(dt)` -> `onBeforePhysicsObservable` -> `physics._step` -> `onAfterPhysicsObservable`.
After the steps: `frameUpdate(dt, alpha)` then `scene.render()`.

## Input
- Actions (`input/actions.ts`) are the only thing game/UI code reads. Sources: `GamepadSource` (polled each
  frame, standard mapping in `gamepadMapping.ts`), `TouchControls` (DOM virtual sticks/buttons, layout from
  settings), `KeyboardMouseSource` (desktop testing only).
- `InputState` merges sources per action (down if any source holds it), latches press edges until consumed,
  and `releaseAll()` blocks still-held buttons until released so state changes never cause phantom presses.
- Edges are consumed after each fixed step (gameplay) or by `ScreenManager.update` (menus open).
- `InputManager` owns the active mode (`touch|gamepad|kbm`), sets `body.input-*` classes; CSS uses them to
  show/hide the focus ring, glyph prompts, and the touch layer.
- iOS exposes a controller only after its first button press: `GamepadSource` scans on every poll, not just on
  `gamepadconnected`.

## UI
- Every menu is a `Screen` on the `ScreenManager` stack. `FocusNav` is shared: any element with `data-focus`
  is navigable; `data-adjust` elements take left/right as `nav-adjust`; `data-capture-nav` elements take all
  directions as `nav-dir`; confirm fires `nav-confirm` then `click`; `data-wrap` containers wrap.
- Use `ui/widgets.ts` (button, toggle, slider, choice, TabView, Dialog). They work identically by touch and pad.
- Screens give footer `hints()`; prompts render glyphs for Xbox/PlayStation/keyboard, picked by CSS.
- Menus register entries via `MainMenuScreen.entries` and settings tabs via `extraSettingsTabs`.
- No `backdrop-filter` over the canvas (expensive on phones). `.screens` container is pointer-events: none;
  children opt in.

## World and player
- Maps (`world/maps/*.ts`) are `MapDef`s: a `build(builder, seed)` that places modular pieces through
  `LevelBuilder` and returns a `MapLayout` (spawns, props, objectives, pickups). Register in `world/maps/index.ts`.
- `LevelBuilder.build` emits thin instances (boxes, cylinders) and one static body with a container shape.
  Use `visible=false` pieces for collision-only helpers (stairs collide as a ramp).
- Characters use `CharacterRig` with a `PartFactory`; `PartLibrary` instances share unit meshes and one
  material with per-instance colour, so any number of characters costs ~5 draw calls.
- `PlayerController` runs in `fixedUpdate`; `Player.frameUpdate` interpolates, updates camera and animation.
- Collision groups/masks/budgets live in `physics/groups.ts`. Shots raycast with membership `PROJECTILE`
  and a `collideWith` mask; hit volumes (`ai/hitboxes.ts`, `game/playerTarget.ts`) are ANIMATED bodies
  registered in the `DamageRegistry`, which maps bodies to `Damageable`s.

## Combat
- Weapon content is JSON (`config/weapons.json`), validated by `validateWeaponDefs`; maths in
  `weapons/weaponStats.ts` (pure). Add a weapon: JSON entry + id in `WEAPON_IDS`.
- `PlayerWeapons` (fixed step) owns fire/reload/swap/grenades; `Ballistics` owns rays and pooled swept
  projectiles; `Explosions` queues detonations (never recursive); `Vfx` pools every effect.
- Anything shootable implements `Damageable` and registers its bodies with `DamageRegistry`.
- HUD (`ui/hud/hud.ts`) only writes DOM when a value changes; minimap redraws at 20 Hz.

## Performance budget (mid-range phone, 60fps)
- Draw calls < 120 in combat. Static level geometry uses thin instances, `freezeWorldMatrix()`, frozen materials.
- Dynamic physics bodies capped (see `physics/budget`). Projectiles/effects pooled, never allocated per shot.
- Render scale: DPR capped at 1.5, then adaptive quality scales further.
- Avoid per-frame allocations in hot paths: reuse `Vector3` temporaries.

## Conventions
- Files: camelCase `.ts`; one main class per file. Tests in `tests/*.test.ts`.
- Pure logic (maths, validation, migrations) stays free of Babylon/DOM so it is unit-testable in node.
- Every phase updates `CHANGELOG.md`, `TESTING.md`, and this file.
