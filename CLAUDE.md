# Shoulder Strike - architecture and conventions

Mobile-only third-person over-the-shoulder shooter. Static web app (Vite + TypeScript + Babylon.js 9 + Havok),
installable PWA, fully playable offline. Hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Commands
- `npm run dev` - dev server (LAN-exposed for phone testing)
- `npm run build` - typecheck + production build into `dist/`
- `npm test` - Vitest unit tests (node env, `fake-indexeddb` for save tests)
- `npm run lint` - ESLint (typescript-eslint)
- `npm run icons` - regenerate procedural PWA icons into `public/icons/`
- `node scripts/smoke.mjs http://localhost:4173/ --shot=out.png` - headless mobile-emulated smoke test
  against `npm run preview`. Fails on any console error or page error. Uses the preinstalled Chromium.

## Hard rules
- No runtime CDN or network dependency. All assets are bundled; Havok WASM is imported with `?url`.
- No external art/audio. Visuals are procedural/primitive; audio is WebAudio synthesis.
- Import Babylon only through `src/core/babylon.ts`. Babylon 9 is tree-shaken and stubs methods whose
  side-effect module is missing (it warns: "requires a side-effect import"). Add the side-effect import there.
- Important data goes to IndexedDB (`src/save`). `localStorage` is never used for saves.
- Coop code lives in `src/net` and is only reached through a dynamic `import()` behind `flags.coop`.
  Single player must never import from `src/net` statically.
- Strict TS (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `verbatimModuleSyntax`: use `import type`).

## Module layout (`src/`)
| Module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `core/` | `babylon.ts` import surface, engine creation, `GameLoop` (fixed 60Hz sim + manual Havok step), event bus, feature flags, scene manager |
| `input/` | Action map; touch, gamepad, keyboard/mouse sources all write the same `InputState` |
| `ui/` | DOM overlay UI. `FocusNav` spatial navigation shared by every menu; screen stack; HUD; debug overlay |
| `physics/` | Havok loading, collision groups, body budget |
| `player/` | Character controller (Havok `PhysicsCharacterController`), over-the-shoulder camera |
| `weapons/` | Data-driven weapons, hitscan + pooled projectiles, recoil/spread, grenades |
| `ai/` | Enemy state machines, grid navmesh + A*, cover points |
| `world/` | Modular tile kit and procedural map builders |
| `progression/` | XP/levels/currency maths, unlock tables, upgrade trees (pure, unit-tested) |
| `cosmetics/` | Avatar part catalogue, procedural materials/camos |
| `save/` | IndexedDB wrapper, versioned schema, migrations, export/import |
| `audio/` | WebAudio synth voices and mixer |
| `vfx/` | Pooled particles, tracers, decals |
| `net/` | Optional coop (Trystero), message schemas + validation |
| `pwa/` | Service worker registration, fullscreen/orientation, gesture suppression |
| `config/` | JSON/TS content data (weapons, enemies, unlock tables) |

## Game loop
`GameLoop` disables Babylon's automatic physics (`scene.physicsEnabled = false`) and steps Havok itself at a
fixed 1/60 s inside an accumulator (max 4 steps/frame, backlog dropped). Order per step:
`fixedUpdate(dt)` -> `onBeforePhysicsObservable` -> `physics._step` -> `onAfterPhysicsObservable`.
After the steps: `frameUpdate(dt, alpha)` then `scene.render()`.

## Performance budget (mid-range phone, 60fps)
- Draw calls < 120 in combat. Static level geometry uses thin instances, `freezeWorldMatrix()`, frozen materials.
- Dynamic physics bodies capped (see `physics/budget`). Projectiles/effects pooled, never allocated per shot.
- Render scale: DPR capped at 1.5, then adaptive quality scales further.
- Avoid per-frame allocations in hot paths: reuse `Vector3` temporaries.

## Conventions
- Files: camelCase `.ts`; one main class per file. Tests in `tests/*.test.ts`.
- Pure logic (maths, validation, migrations) stays free of Babylon/DOM so it is unit-testable in node.
- Every phase updates `CHANGELOG.md`, `TESTING.md`, and this file.
